fvwm3 (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    FVWM3 is the successor to FVWM. FVWM3 will include new features and
    breaking changes to FVWM. FVWM3 is currently mostly compatible with
    FVWM and most config options still work. See the upstream changelog,
    /usr/share/doc/fvwm3/changelog.gz, for a list of changes.

    The Debian package contains some changes from upstream in order to
    ensure that fvwm3 and fvwm don't conflict.

      + All the helper binaries are renamed from fvwm-name to fvwm3-name.
        This includes fvwm3-config, fvwm3-convert-2.6, fvwm3-menu-desktop,
        fvwm3-menu-directory, fvwm3-menu-xlock, fvwm3-perllib, and fvwm3-root.
 
      + Man pages for modules have been renamed to Fvwm3Module (the module
        names are unchanged).

      + If you have both fvwm3 and fvwm installed be sure to use the
        appropriate fvwm3 binaries and man pages to avoid issues.

    FVWM3 uses the same configuration file, ~/.fvwm/config, as FVWM.
    If you wish to use a different configuration file you can either
    set the FVWM_USERDIR=~/.fvwm3 environment variable or launch
    fvwm3 with the -f config_file option.

    The Debian package does not include the new module FvwmPrompt due
    to golang dependences.
