fvwm3 (1.1.5+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    The fvwm3 package now provides FvwmPrompt and no longer provides
    FvwmConsole. This means config files that use FvwmConsole need
    to be updated. FvwmPrompt is a binary that runs in any terminal
    emulator. It can open a simple shell, similar to FvwmConsole, to
    send multiple commands to fvwm by running `FvwmPrompt`. It can
    also issue a single command, similar to FvwmCommand, by running
    `FvwmPrompt <command>`. To update a config file to launch a terminal
    emulator that is running FvwmPrompt use something similar to
    (replaces the `Module FvwmConsole` command):

        Exec exec x-terminal-emulator -T FvwmPrompt -e FvwmPrompt
